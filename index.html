                        Fake news is a hot topic these days. The spread of misinformation has become so prevalent that countries around the world have even begun to legislate against it.<br><br>

                        On the internet, anyone can be a publisher but not everyone knows how to properly vet the information they consume. Whether false or misleading information was created maliciously or unintentionally, individuals need to know how to discern the trustworthiness of the content they consume.<br><br> 
                            
                        Take a moment to read one of the following articles:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.poynter.org/news/guide-anti-misinformation-actions-around-world">Anti-misinformation Actions Around the World</a>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        How trustworthy is the article you read? Can you find a more 
                        credible website confirming or contradicting the information proffered in the article? How can we assess the validity of a website?

                        The CARS Checklist (Credibility, Accuracy, Reasonableness, Support) is a framework which helps us gauge the validity of the websites we browse. It’s important to realize that even credible websites with high quality content may not meet every criteria of this checklist. Though unlikely, some disreputable sites might even meet every list item. Even while utilizing this checklist, we should always be consuming content thoughtfully!
